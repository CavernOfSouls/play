			<p> Despite the sharp pain you are experiencing, you face Belzeguur and are ready to fight.

			<p> Watching the Demon rush straight at you, you realize that you will most likely die.

			<p> As it lands and grabs you by the neck, <span style="color:red">you swing the blade as hard as you can, aiming for the heart</span>.

			<p> To your surprise, the small blade actually manages to pierce through fur and skin. Belzeguur drops you and begins to screams in agony.

			<p> <span style="color:orange">You see a glowing light radiating out of the wound, turning flesh into dust.</span> A few seconds later, you hear two distinct noises as two objects fall on the ground.

			<p> When the cloud of ash finally clears up, you see your (t)rusty knife and... <span style="color:gold">a yellow crystal!</span>.
