		<h2>The Pool of Souls</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> A blue portal opened on the blank wall. As you crossed it, you felt it drain some of your energy.

			<p> You now find yourself in a large cave. In front of you, an enormous pit filled with strange waters. On the other side, you can see an exit. The only way to get to it is to walk along a <span style="color:gold">narrow precipice</span> bordering the pool.

			<p> As you take a closer look at the water, you notice what made it look weird at first glance - <br> it is filled with hundreads of <span style="color:gold">shadows</span>, swimming around endlessly.

			<p> Both fascinated and frightened, you begin to cross on the edge of the precipice.

			<p> Suddenly, the shadows below you start lamenting. You are startled, and as a result begin to slip!

			<p> Are you agile enough to secure your footing? <span style="color:gold">Fate will decide...</span>
