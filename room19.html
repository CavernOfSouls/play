			<p> You run as fast as you can, aiming straight for the large axe.

			<p> You begin climbing the rock just as Belzeguur starts to rush towards you.

			<p> You finally grasp the weapon - it is a <span style="color:red">beautiful, double-edged battle axe</span>. In fact, now that you are next to it, it looks almost as long as you are tall. With all the force you can generate, you try to pick it up. It is too heavy.

			<p> Suddenly, a huge arm hits you and pushes you off the rock. In pain, <span style="color:red">you watch Belzeguur pick up ITS axe</span>.

			<p> Terrorized, you watch the blade swing straight at your face...
