		<h1><span style="color:crimson">BELZEGUUR</span></h1>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You enter the demon's catacomb, and soon realize that it makes up the majority of the pyramid's volume. The ceiling is dozens of meters heigh. The ground is composed of <span style="color:red">black rocks</span>, on which are scattered a few boulders and bone piles. In front of you, the rocks drop down to form a ditch, beyond which you see a <span style="color:red">lake of lava</span>.

			<p> Crouching on top of a boulder near the lava, you spot a large creature. It is almost five times as large as you. While it looks humanoid, it has <span style="color:red">the wings of a dragon, the fur of a wolf and the face of a bat</span>.

			<p> You approach slowly - the Beast is currently feeding and has not yet noticed you. You reach for the crossbow strapped to your back, load it with an arrow, and fire at the Demon!

			<p> The arrow bounces of its skin and does no damage. There goes your advantage - <span style="color:red"> Belzeguur swiftly turns around, its eyes burning like embers</span>.

			<p> You fire two more arrows, but they are just as ineffective as the first. You must quickly find another weapon, or hide!

			<p> On the far size of the catacomb, you see a <span style="color:red">large axe</span>, sitting atop a large rock. A few steps in front of you, you see a skeleton holding a <span style="color:red">rusty pocket knife</span>. Near the entrance on your right, between Belzeguur and you, there is a <span style="color:red;">crevace</span> large enough for you to hide in, but too small for the Demon to reach you.

			<p> What do you go for? DECIDE NOW!
