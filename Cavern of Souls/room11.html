		<h2>The Hot Room</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> The deeper you go into the cavern's guts, the hotter it gets. Soon, you are having trouble breathing.

			<p> The stone walls around you are slowly turning incandescent red...

			<p> After several minutes going down, you still cannot see the end of the staircase. Realizing that going this way was a mistake, you decide to go back up.

			<p> Unfortunately, the extreme temperature is getting to you. You feel weak, about to faint. You try to drink water from your gourd, but it feels as if you just boiled it.

			<p> You realize that you will never be able to make it back up. So sad! Your journey had just begun...
