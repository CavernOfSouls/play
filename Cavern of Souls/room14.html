		<h2>Falling Spikes</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You take your time navigating around the falling stalagtites. Seeing as how randomly they fall, you think that you made the right decision!

			<p> Almost halfway through the <span style="color:gold">dripstone cave</span>, the rumbling and shaking intensifies.

			<p> You are doing your best to avoid the spikes raining down on you, but there is a limit to what you can do...

			<p> The danger is now everywhere. Perhaps you should have ran aftera...

			<p> Before you can even finish your thought, <span style="color:gold">you feel a sharp pain, then nothing</span>.
