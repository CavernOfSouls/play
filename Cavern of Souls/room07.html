		<h2>The Abyssals</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> An orange portal opened on the blank wall. As you crossed it, you felt it drain some of your energy.

			<p> You find yourself in a dark place. You cannot see much, but understand you are no longer in the Cavern of Souls.

			<p> As the portal closes behind you, you hear things moving around you in the distance.

			<p> In the total darkness, bright <span style="color:gold">red flashes</span> begin to appear. They do not last long, but for a brief moment they let you know what you are dealing with.

			<p> You recognize the creatures from legends: <br> they are <span style="color:gold">Abyssals</span>! Otherwordly horrors, best described as the things nightmares are affraid of.

			<p> Inbetween flashes, you can hear them creeping closer to you. <span style="color:gold">You are surrounded</span>. The red light they emit from their lures get brighter and brighter as they approach. 

			<p> Suddently, a blinding light appears. As you realize one of the Abyssals is less than a meter in front of you, the <span style="color:gold">sharp pain</span> of its bite tearing your body appart is the last thing you will ever feel...
