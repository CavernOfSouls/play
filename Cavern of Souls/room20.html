			<p> You quickly reach the skeleton and try to pry the <span style="color:red">pocket knife</span> out of its hand.

			<p> Within seconds, Belzeguur jumps off its boulder and begins to fly straight at you!

			<p> As you finally manage to take the knife, <span style="color:red">you accidently cut yourself...</span>

			<p> The cut is very small, but burns more than expected. You notice that the blade is not actually rusty, but rather that it is drenched in a <span style="color:red">rust-colored liquid...</span>
