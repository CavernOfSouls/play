		<h2>Smite the Impure</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You put on the armor as fast as you can, affraid Belzaguur the demon will catch you off-guard.

			<p> As you smile and feel ready for the fight of your life, you feel... <span style="color:gold">a burning sensation</span>... everywhere...

			<p> The metal armor turns red as if it was still being forged. Now fused with your skin, there is now way you can take it off.

			<p> Inbetween <span style="color:gold">waves of searing pain</span>, you start to think that whoever left the armor and the parchemin there must have done it to trick heretics wanting to steal their God's treasure

			<p> This means you are the impure, and this is why you are being smitten...
