		<h2>Ashkanat's Offering</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You take a moment to rest - running for your life across the dripstone cave got you tired...

			<p> As you catch your breath, you take the time to investigate this new room you have found yourself into.

			<p> You see in the center a pedestal. Beyond it, the room splits into two forked corridors. At the end of each is a closed door - one is green, the other is red.

			<p> You take a closer look at the pedestal. On it, you see an inscription just above two dials. The inscription reads:

			<p> "We who have built the Cavern of Souls believe in <span style="color:gold">Ashkanat, the one true God</span>. No other deity stands to her might. Ye who wish to continue must be as devout as we are. If you know what Ashkanat demands as offering, the <span style="color:gold">believer's door</span> shall open. Else, you will perish by <span style="color:gold">heretic's door</span>! Praise be to Ashkanat!"

			<p> You take a closer look at the dials. Both are surrounded by a series of words. One points to <span style="color:gold">foods</span>, the other points to <span style="color:gold">beverages</span>. You understand that you need to select the two correct options to indicate what offering is made to Ashkanat.

			<p> Do you know what to choose? Double-click on the text fields to open the drop-down menu.
