			<p> As the red door opens, the opening leading back to the dripstone cave collapses.

			<p> Water comes rushing from the red door's corridor. It looks as if you have been deemed a <span style="color:gold">heretic</span>.

			<p> You play around with the two dials, trying to find the correct combination... but it's no use. <br> By now, you have water up to your hips.

			<p> You swim towards the green door and try to get it open. There are no knobs, levers or anything else that might be useful. The water keeps rising, now up your torso... now up your neck... now above your head...
