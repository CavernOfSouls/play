		<h2>Portals</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You walk into a room, but to your surprise, it is a <span style="color:gold">dead end</span>!

			<p> The wall <span style="color:gold">facing you</span> is completely blank.

			<p> The wall on your <span style="color:gold">left</span> is decorated with primitive hand paintings. They seem to depict a group of people venerating a humanoid entity. Under them, you see pictograms of pale red mushrooms and bottles with fish drawn on their labels.

			<p> The wall on your <span style="color:gold">right</span> is engraved with a message, atop of a blue gem and an orange gem. The text reads:

			<p> <span style="color:gold">"Press on the blue gem to activate the portal of shadows". <br> "Press on the orange gem to activate the portal of lights". <br> "For whichever you choose, life force shall be the price..."</span>

			<p> As there is no other way out, you decide to activate one of the portals. Which one will it be?
