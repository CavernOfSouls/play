		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You make your way into the right side of the cavern. As you walk a long corridor, you hear a noise.

			<p> The more you walk, the louder the noise becomes. You begin to recorgnize it: it's someone <span style="color:gold">crying</span>.

			<p> You finally arrive in a large room. On the left, you see a door. On the right, you notice a <span style="color:gold">woman</span> - <br> she is the one you have been hearing.

			<p> Is she lost? Not likely, given that she is this close to the entrance. Perhaps she is harmed?

			<p> What do you do? Do you go <span style="color:gold">talk to her</span> and try to help? Or do you just ignore her and <span style="color:gold">carry on</span> with your quest?
