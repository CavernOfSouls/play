			<p> Unfortunately, you are unable to stop youself from slipping and falling into the pit.

			<p> As you fall, the lamenting below grows louder. When you hit the water... you realize it was not water after all...

			<p> The shadows break their circular formation and begin to swim frantically across the <span style="color:gold">gelatinous substance</span>, towards you.

			<p> They look human, yet are clearly <span style="color:gold">uncorporial</span>. One of them has a scar over its left eye, fitting the description of another adventurer you know ventured into the Cavern of Souls, never to return. 

			<p> As they get to you, you feel them tearing your soul out from your body. Then, you feel nothing anymore. As the shadows resume their endless cycle around the pool, you do the same.

			<p> <span style="color:gold">The Cavern of Souls has just claimed its newest victim...</span>
