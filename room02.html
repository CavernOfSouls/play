		<h2>The Warm Room</h2>

		<div class = "textBox">

			<p> You arrive in a small room. Right at the threshold, you start to feel the temperature rising. Sweat starts to pour down your forehead.

			<p> In front of you, you notice an <span style="color:gold">old wooden ladder</span>. It goes up an opening in the ceiling. On your left, there is an large crevace in the wall, through which you can see a <span style="color:gold">stony spiral staircase</span> going further down into the cavern.

			<p> Which way should you go?
